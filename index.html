            Hello, I'm Caleb. My passion for graphic design all started with my love for anime.  In 2018 I was scrolling Instagram and came across a post which was an anime character but edited to look as though they were wearing brand names. 
            </p>
            <p>
            This had peaked my interest and started my journey into the graphic arts world. Since then I have created various anime related projects and shared them with the community that inspired me.
